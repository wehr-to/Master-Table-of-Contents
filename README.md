# Master-Table-of-Contents
- A complete organized guide to every repository I have and the *why* I built it

## Infra: 
### 1: https://github.com/wehr-to/netgate-homelab-ops - My flagship project, my Netgate 6100, Raspberry Pi 5, and Ryzen 7 PC homelab, fully operational and mapped out, serving as an educational simulation of enterprise operations
### 2: https://github.com/wehr-to/linux-hardening-toolkit - I built this toolkit to harden the environments almost everything in a real org runs on, each module is meant to be tweakable for different production stacks.
### 3: https://github.com/wehr-to/network-telemetry - This repository goes beyond analyzing dashboards it focuses on understanding **where telemetry comes from**, **what data matters**, and **how to extract it** for real network insight using SNMP, NetFlow, and Syslog. It's about the ingestion layer, not just the visual output.
### 4: https://github.com/wehr-to/netmiko-ops-scripts - A curated stack of protoyped network automation scripts, with the pseudologic written out with each script to reinforce the *why* behind each script and it's function, using the netmiko library within cisco workshops. 

## Case-Studies
### 1: https://github.com/wehr-to/ciso-perspective-case-study - I built this to understand security from a CISO's lens, not only are the technicals important, but understanding business objectives is critical to seeing the bigger picture.


## Study-Guides
### 1: https://github.com/wehr-to/CCNA-Study-Guide - A proof-of-concept of my understanding of the CCNA exam material, with testing strategies, command lists, theory, and study material references
