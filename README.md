# Master-Table-of-Contents
A complete organized guide to every repository I have and the *why* I built it

## Infra: 
1: https://github.com/wehr-to/linux-hardening-toolkit - I built this toolkit to harden the environments almost everything in a real org runs on
2: https://github.com/wehr-to/network-telemetry - This repository goes beyond analyzing dashboards it focuses on understanding **where telemetry comes from**, **what data matters**, and **how to extract it** for real network insight using SNMP, NetFlow, and Syslog. It's about the ingestion layer, not just the visual output.


## Case-Studies
1: https://github.com/wehr-to/ciso-perspective-case-study - I built this to understand security from a CISO's lens, not only are the technicals important, but understanding business objectives is critical to seeing the bigger picture.
