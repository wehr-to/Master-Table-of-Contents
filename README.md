# Master-Table-of-Contents

### A complete map of every repo I've built and why, covering **Infra**, **SIEM**, **OffSec**, **AppSec**, **Cloud**, **Case Studies**, **Study Guides**, and other fun projects. 

## Infra: 
### 1: https://github.com/wehr-to/netgate-homelab-ops - My flagship project, my Netgate 6100, Raspberry Pi 5, and Ryzen 7 PC homelab, fully operational and mapped out, serving as an educational simulation of blue team enterprise operations
### 2: https://github.com/wehr-to/linux-hardening-toolkit - I built this toolkit to harden the environments almost everything in a real org runs on, each module is meant to be tweakable for different production stacks.
### 3: https://github.com/wehr-to/network-telemetry - This repository goes beyond analyzing dashboards it focuses on understanding **where telemetry comes from**, **what data matters**, and **how to extract it** for real network insight using SNMP, NetFlow, and Syslog. It's about the ingestion layer, not just the visual output.
### 4: https://github.com/wehr-to/netmiko-ops-scripts - A curated stack of protoyped network automation scripts, with the pseudocode written out with each script to reinforce the *why* behind each script and it's function, using the netmiko library within cisco workshops. 
### 5: https://github.com/wehr-to/cisco-ops-manual - A practical simulated operations manual that reflects the difficulty level of the CCNP exam, aimed to mimick real day-to-day network engineering tasks and provide insight to the role's responsibilities and see things from a network engineers perspective.
### 6: https://github.com/wehr-to/network-design-case-studies - This repository documents network design patterns, case studies, and reference architectures with a focus on real-world enterprise infrastructure. It combines the perspective of a network engineer and a security engineer, asking not only “how do packets flow?” but also “how do we protect them?”
### 7: https://github.com/wehr-to/wireshark-playbook - This repository contains hands-on labs and investigative writeups designed to deepen my understanding of protocol behavior, traffic patterns, and forensic network analysis.
### 8: https://github.com/wehr-to/dns-ops-and-security - This repository explores DNS from both operational and security perspectives. It includes labs, threat detection techniques, protocol comparisons, and real-world misconfig scenarios.
### 9: https://github.com/wehr-to/windows-internals-toolkit - A hands on blue team focused toolkit to explore and baseline Windows internals across file systems, processes, services, and malware artifacts *no live malware included*

## Case-Studies
### 1: https://github.com/wehr-to/Failure-Aware-Engineering - My flagship case study, this repository is my interpretation of proactive engineering practices, it explores how I approach problems through a proactive lens, with a focus on system design, tradeoffs, failure paths, and security first engineering
### 2: https://github.com/wehr-to/ciso-perspective-case-study - I built this to understand security from a CISO's lens, not only are the technicals important, but understanding business objectives is critical to seeing the bigger picture.


## Study-Guides
### 1: https://github.com/wehr-to/CCNA-Study-Guide - A proof-of-concept of my understanding of the CCNA exam material, with testing strategies, command lists, theory, and study material references
